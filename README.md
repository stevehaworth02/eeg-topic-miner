## 1. Background

Throughout my research endeavors, I've always sought out quality research papers within my field. With over 50,000 NIH publications, finding what I need has never been harder. Me and my labmates spend significant time digging for relevant papers. As mainstream search engines became increasingly monetized and therefore less precise, the problem grew. What if finding the right paper could be as simple as asking a question?  

This project aims to provide just that: a fast, semantic search engine for the latest neuroscience, EEG, and sleep research, powered by deep learning and AI. Furthermore, for Systematic Reviews, a user can easily input their PubMed queries into queries.txt to retrain the model and recieve more personalized results while maintaining the filtering

## 2. Technology

- **Automated, Modular Pipeline:**  
  Each step (data harvesting, preprocessing, training, indexing, querying) is scripted and reproducible, making updates and debugging simple.

- **Cross-Platform & Containerization:**  
  Runs on Windows, Mac, or Linuxâ€”and **Docker** support means users donâ€™t have to fight with dependencies or CUDA compatibility.

- **Pretrained Models and Artifacts:**  
  All large artifacts (trained models, FAISS indexes, tokenized datasets) are hosted on Hugging Face, keeping the repo clean and speeding up setup.

- **CI/CD-Ready:**  
  The design allows future integration with continuous integration and deployment pipelinesâ€”automating retraining, evaluation, and deployment as new data comes in.

- **User-Facing AI Search:**  
  Our semantic search uses **SciBERT** to encode user queries and abstracts, with FAISS for blazing-fast similarity search across thousands of publications.

### Bugs & Contact

If you find a bug, issue, or something isnâ€™t working as expected, **please donâ€™t panic!**  
Reach out at [0218steven@gmail.com](mailto:0218steven@gmail.com) and Iâ€™ll help as soon as possible.

### Training Your Own Model

Model retraining is **disabled by default** for user-friendliness, reliability, and fast setup.

**If you want to train your own model:**
- **Uncomment** the training command in your platformâ€™s pipeline file:
  - In `run_pipeline.ps1` (Windows/PowerShell)
  - In `run_pipeline.sh` (Linux/Mac/Docker)
- Or, you may run the training script manually:
  - **Windows:**
    ```powershell
    python scripts/train_serial.py --data_dir data/tokenised --out_dir models/scibert_best
    ```
  - **Linux/Mac/Docker:**
    ```bash
    python src/train.py --data_dir data/tokenised --out_dir models/scibert_best
    ```
- Youâ€™ll need **significant compute power** (expect long runtimes on CPU; CUDA-compatible GPUs are strongly recommended).
- **Note:** By default, the pipeline will use the latest pretrained models and indexes hosted on Hugging Face.

**On Mac/Linux:**

- Run with **Docker** for maximum reliability (recommended for most users; handles all dependencies for you), or
- Run with `run_pipeline.sh` if you want a **native setup** (runs directly on your systemâ€™s Python, best for users comfortable with installing dependencies).

- **Warning:** Training on CPU may take hours; CUDA-compatible GPUs are strongly recommended for reasonable training speed (Queries take milliseconds though!).

## 4. Features

- **Domain-Fine-Tuned Model:**  
  My SciBERT model was fine-tuned on EEG, sleep, and neurology abstracts, so you get results tailored to your domain rather not just generic science.

- **Semantic Matching (Fine-Tuned!):**  
  Uses a fine-tuned SciBERT model trained specifically for EEG, neurology, and sleep literatureâ€”plus FAISS, to surface papers similar in meaning, not just text overlap. Results are actually relevant to your research, rather than just linguistically similar.

- **Blazing-Fast Search:**  
  Query thousands of abstracts in milliseconds with FAISS, even on a laptop.

- **Zero Setup Headaches:**  
  Get started instantly: use Docker or PowerShell for no CUDA or messy installs.

- **Automatic Metadata & Weak Labels:**  
  Each abstract is auto-tagged by topic (seizure, sleep, BCI, or unlabeled) and flagged for deep learning content which enable smart filters and fast dataset exploration.

- **Reproducible, Modular Pipeline:**  
  Data harvesting, preprocessing, training, indexing, and querying are all broken into clear, reusable scriptsâ€”easy to update, debug, or extend.

- **Cross-Platform (Windows, Mac, Linux):**  
  Search, build, and query on any OS, just choose the right pipeline or Docker image.

- **Future-Proof & CI/CD Ready:**  
  The architecture is designed for continuous improvement: we can plug in new data, re-index, or retrain as needed (or just query if you prefer!).

- **Open Source, Fully Documented:**  
  All code, scripts, and guides are open and well-commented, so you can learn, adapt, or contribute.
