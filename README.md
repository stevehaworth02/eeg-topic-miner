### Bugs & Contact

If you find a bug, issue, or something isnâ€™t working as expected, **please donâ€™t panic!**

### Training Your Own Model

Want to train your own model? Hereâ€™s what to do:

- Youâ€™ll need **significant compute power** (expect very long runtimes on CPU, recommend using a CUDA-compatible GPU).
- The training pipeline is set up in `run_pipeline.ps1` (Windows/PowerShell) and `run_pipeline.sh` (Linux/Mac/Docker).
- To retrain:  
  - Make sure your data is prepared and in the correct format.
  - Run the training step manually:  
    - On Windows:  
      ```
      python scripts/train_serial.py --data_dir data/tokenised --out_dir models/scibert_best
      ```
    - On Linux/Mac:  
      ```
      python src/train.py --data_dir data/tokenised --out_dir models/scibert_best
      ```
- **Warning:** Training on CPU may take hours; CUDA-compatible GPUs are strongly recommended for reasonable speed.
